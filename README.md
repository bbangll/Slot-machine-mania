## General info & Rules

Welcome to my Slot Machine Mania project! It's a game where with a click of button can make you filthy rich or send you straight down the food chain. Roll up your sleeves and take your chances.

Good Luck!!

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SVG

## Getting Started

Instructions:
1. Add how much you want to bet
2. Click on the spin button to start the slot machine.

There are three slots. 
- First slot: Randomly generates a potential earning, ranging from $2-$20.
- Second slot: Randomly generates a multiplier of that earning, ranging from 1x-10x.
- Third slot: Random chooses whether you win or lose.

Your total would be your total sum. Keep in mind that with each spin, there's a service cost of $10.00. The 'Check Summary' button would give you more information.

## Next Steps
- I want to add a setTimeout on the total, so that users wont see whether they gained money or loss money before the slots finished loading.
- I want to add an extremely faded lottie animation for the background.
